# python_hdl

A class-based model of the nand2tetris HACK architecture down to the logic gate level to test the accuracy/completeness of the design without resorting to tricks such as skipping the implemention of the DFF circuits. This has a rather extreme performance penalty so it is more of a proof of concept than anything else.
